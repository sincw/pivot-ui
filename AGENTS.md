# Pivot UI  - Development Notes

## Quick Start

```bash
npm run dev   # port 30141
```

Typecheck: `node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit`  
Lint: `npm run lint`  
**Never run `next build` during dev** — pollutes `.next/` and breaks `npm run dev`.

**Session browsing** (read-only): reads `.jsonl` files through SDK `SessionManager` helpers and `lib/session-reader.ts` — no AgentSession created.  
**Sending a message**: `startRpcSession()` in `lib/rpc-manager.ts` creates an AgentSession in-process.

## Key Design Decisions & Traps

### AgentSession lifecycle (`lib/rpc-manager.ts`)
- One `AgentSessionWrapper` per session id, keyed in `globalThis.__piSessions`
- `globalThis` survives Next.js hot-reload; plain module-level Map does not
- Idle timeout: 10 minutes. Concurrent `startRpcSession()` calls share a single start Promise (`globalThis.__piStartLocks`)

### Fork must destroy the wrapper immediately
`AgentSession.fork()` **mutates the wrapper's inner state in-place** — after fork, `inner.sessionId` is the *new* session's id. If the wrapper stays alive in the registry under the old id, the next request gets the already-forked state and subsequent forks produce a corrupt `parentSession` chain.

**Fix**: `send("fork")` captures `newSessionId`, then calls `this.destroy()` before returning. The next request for the original session reloads a clean AgentSession from the original file.

### Two kinds of branching — don't confuse them
- **Fork** (Fork button on user message): creates a new independent `.jsonl` file. Shown as a child in the sidebar tree via `parentSession` header field.
- **In-session branch** (Continue button / BranchNavigator): calls `navigate_tree` within the same file. Multiple entries share the same `parentId`. Switching between them calls `/api/sessions/[id]/context?leafId=`.

### Session files can be fully rewritten
`parentSession` in the header is **display metadata only** — has zero effect on chat content. Safe to `writeFileSync` the entire file (pi does this itself during migrations). Used when cascade-reparenting children on delete.

### ToolCall field normalization
Pi stores toolCall blocks as `{type:"toolCall", id, name, arguments}` but `ToolCallContent` uses `{toolCallId, toolName, input}`. `normalizeToolCalls()` in `lib/normalize.ts` handles this — called in both `session-reader.ts` (file load) and `ChatWindow.handleAgentEvent()` (streaming).

### New session tool preset
Tool names are passed at session creation (`POST /api/agent/new` → `toolNames[]`). For existing sessions, the active preset is inferred on mount via `get_tools` → `getPresetFromTools()`. When tools are fully disabled (`toolNames = []`), `rpc-manager.ts` passes an empty tool allow-list and forces `agent.state.systemPrompt = ""` after startup/reload/resource discovery.

### Model defaults for new sessions
`GET /api/models` returns `defaultModel` read from `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`. `ChatWindow` pre-selects this on mount for new sessions.

### SSE reconnect on page refresh mid-stream
On `ChatWindow` mount, `GET /api/agent/[id]` is called. If `state.isStreaming === true`, SSE is reconnected automatically. `thinkingLevel` and `isCompacting` are also synced from this response.

### Compaction SSE events
Newer pi emits `compaction_start` / `compaction_end`; older versions emitted `auto_compaction_start` / `auto_compaction_end`. `handleAgentEvent` accepts both sets to keep `isCompacting` in sync. Manual compact is a blocking POST — the button stays disabled until the response returns.

### Running state SSE + reconciliation
- The sidebar listens to `/api/agent/running/events`, backed by `subscribeRunningSessions()` in `lib/rpc-manager.ts`, so running badges update without polling.
- `useAgentSession` still treats per-session SSE as primary for chat events, but while a run is active it periodically calls `GET /api/agent/[id]` and also reconciles on `visibilitychange`/`online`. This fixes missed `agent_end` events from background tabs or half-open connections.
- Prompt runs use a monotonic run id; late SSE or slow reconciliation responses from an old run must be ignored so they cannot resurrect stale streaming bubbles.

### Chat and Pack ownership
- `ChatWindow` composes `useAgentSession` with `useChatViewport`. Keep DOM refs, scrolling, history paging, and completion positioning in the viewport hook; the session hook must not manipulate DOM.
- `AgentRunState` is the synchronous source of truth for run identity, reconciliation decisions, and deferred Pack reload. Keep SSE connection, event projection, and commands co-located in `useAgentSession` until they can move together behind a smaller interface.
- `WorkspacePacks` owns workspace Pack preview, apply, and unapply. `SkillsConfig` renders it and refreshes skills through `onApplied`; do not duplicate Pack mutation state there.

### Worktrees and project grouping
- `lib/worktree.ts` resolves linked worktree top-levels back to the main repo `projectRoot`; `listAllSessions()` attaches that to each `SessionInfo` so all worktrees for one repo are grouped together in the sidebar.
- Worktree operations are served by `/api/worktrees` and guarded by the same allowed-root rules as `/api/files`.
- New worktrees are created under `<repoRoot>-worktrees/<sanitized-branch>`. Existing branches are reused; otherwise `git worktree add -b` creates the branch.
- Removing a dirty worktree returns `409` with `{ dirty: true }` so the UI can ask before retrying with `force`.
- Sessions whose cwd points at a removed worktree are inferred back into the main project instead of becoming a phantom project row.

### Right-panel tools
- `RightPanel` owns its tool and file tabs. It persists `{ fileTabs, toolTabs, activeTabId, panelOpen }` in `localStorage` under `pi-right-panel:<projectRoot>`; changing worktrees in the same project updates tab cwd values, while changing projects restores that project's saved tabs.
- Add a same-level tool by creating one `right-panel/*Tool.tsx` feature definition (`id`, label, description, icon, component) and adding it to `right-panel/tool-registry.ts`. The registry drives the launcher, creation menu, and tool-tab icon; do not add tool-specific branches or unions to `AppShell` or `TabBar`.
- File previews are core tabs, not registered tools. `AppShell` opens chat-linked files through `RightPanelHandle`; tool components receive file and reveal callbacks through `RightPanelToolProps`.
- `right-panel-fullscreen` is application-local CSS (`fixed; inset: 0`), not browser fullscreen; the toolbar button toggles it and `Escape` exits. In fullscreen, review lists cap at 300px; Changes and History share the same non-fullscreen list width.

### Git review and workspace files
- `ReviewTool` owns Changes, branch comparison, and History. It fetches file status/diffs from `/api/git-diff`, commit summaries and one-file commit content from `/api/git-history`, and Git actions/branch data from `/api/git`.
- History's left side contains only the commit graph and subject. Selecting a commit loads its files, then selecting one file renders that file's parent-to-commit diff. Keep unified mode as the default; `InlineDiff` also supplies A/B mode.
- A/B diffs are two equal-width panes with a 160px minimum. Each pane owns horizontal overflow; do not reintroduce one shared, full-width horizontal scrollbar.
- `WorkspaceFileTree` is shared by the sidebar and File Tree tool. It supports optional mutations via `/api/workspace-files`; `revealRequest` must expand each path ancestor before selecting the file. `loadDirectory()` updates `nodesRef` when the request resolves so deep reveal traversal does not use stale tree data.
- `/api/files` remains read-only. Its `hideHidden=1` query parameter lets the workspace tree omit dotfiles; write operations belong only in `/api/workspace-files` and must remain workspace-root and symlink constrained.

### File access allow-list
- `/api/files` is intentionally not a general filesystem browser. Allowed roots come from session cwds, their resolved project roots, `~/pi-cwd-*`, and roots explicitly added with `allowFileRoot()`.
- `/api/cwd/validate`, `/api/default-cwd`, and `/api/worktrees` call `allowFileRoot()` when they make a new location browsable.

### Plugins and skills
- `/api/plugins` uses pi's `SettingsManager` + `DefaultPackageManager` for global/project package install, remove, update, enable, and disable. Disabling writes empty `extensions/skills/prompts/themes` arrays for that package entry.
- `/api/skills` uses `DefaultResourceLoader` so settings paths, package skills, and project `.agents/skills` are listed the same way the runtime sees them.
- Skill toggling edits only the `disable-model-invocation` frontmatter key on the target `SKILL.md`; keep that surgical so user formatting survives.
- `/api/skills/install` shells through `npx skills add ... --agent pi`; project installs run with the selected cwd.

### Skill packs
- The global configuration is `~/.pi/agent/skill-packs.json`; its default `libraryRoot` is `~/.pivot-ui/lib/skills`. Library skills live under `<libraryRoot>/.pi/skills/<skillKey>`, while MCP metadata lives under `<libraryRoot>/.pi/mcp-servers/<serverKey>.mcp.json`. Workspace state is `<cwd>/.pi/skill-packs.json`; Pack-managed MCP entries live in `<cwd>/.pi/mcp.json`.
- A Pack holds `{ skillKey, contentHash }` and `{ serverKey, configHash }` snapshots. `previewWorkspacePackChange()` computes the full Pack union, blocks missing/stale entries and same-key/different-hash conflicts, then `applyWorkspacePackChange()` atomically applies skills, MCP changes, and the receipt. Keep MCP reconciliation in `lib/mcp-pack-apply.ts`, combined transaction logic in `lib/skill-pack-apply.ts`, and state-only operations in `lib/workspace-packs.ts`.
- MCP reconciliation never overwrites a team `.mcp.json`, unowned `.pi/mcp.json` entry, or a Pack-managed entry changed outside Pivot UI. Unapply removes only entries no remaining Pack needs and that Pivot UI still owns; skill removal retains the existing union-based behavior and can remove a pre-existing same-name skill that was skipped during apply.
- Library MCP CRUD and Pack editing do not require the MCP adapter. Any workspace mutation with an MCP effect does; routes must enforce readiness, not only the UI.
- Applying or removing a pack calls `SkillsConfig.onPacksChanged`, which increments `AppShell.packsRefreshKey`. `useAgentSession` owns the resulting reload: defer it while the agent runs, refresh `get_commands` after reload, and await the same Promise before the next prompt. Do not add competing reload effects in `ChatWindow`.
- Tests: `lib/content-hash.test.mjs`, `lib/skill-library.test.mjs`, `lib/mcp-library.test.mjs`, `lib/skill-packs-store.test.mjs`, `lib/workspace-packs.test.mjs`, `lib/skill-pack-apply.test.mjs`, `lib/mcp-pack-apply.test.mjs`, and `components/ChatWindow.test.mjs`. See `docs/skill-packs.md` for the implementation-level behavior.

### Auth and model config
- `ModelsConfig` combines models from `~/.pi/agent/models.json` with provider auth status from pi's `AuthStorage`/`ModelRegistry`.
- OAuth/device-code/manual-code flows are streamed by `GET /api/auth/login/[provider]`; manual code responses POST back with a short-lived token stored in `globalThis.__piLoginCallbacks`.
- API-key routes store and remove keys through `AuthStorage`. Status endpoints must never return the raw key.
- The model test route is `app/api/models-config/test/route.ts`; `app/api/models/test/` is not a real route.

### Completion sound
- `hooks/useAudio.ts` stores the toggle in `localStorage` as `pi-sound-enabled` and reuses one `AudioContext`.
- Browser autoplay policy means sound must be unlocked from a user gesture; `ChatInput` calls the unlock hook from interactive controls, and `ChatWindow` plays the tone from `onAgentEnd`.

### Exported session HTML
- `/api/sessions/[id]/export` delegates to pi's export helper, then patches recursive tree helpers in the generated HTML to iterative versions so very deep linear sessions do not overflow the browser call stack.

## Pi Session File Format

Location: `~/.pi/agent/sessions/<encoded-cwd>/<timestamp>_<uuid>.jsonl`

```jsonl
{"type":"session","version":3,"id":"<uuid>","timestamp":"...","cwd":"/path","parentSession":"/abs/path/to/parent.jsonl"}
{"type":"model_change","id":"<8hex>","parentId":null,"provider":"zenmux","modelId":"claude-sonnet-4-6","timestamp":"..."}
{"type":"message","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","message":{"role":"user","content":"..."}}
{"type":"message","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","message":{"role":"assistant","content":[...],...}}
{"type":"message","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","message":{"role":"toolResult","toolCallId":"...","content":[...]}}
{"type":"compaction","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","summary":"...","firstKeptEntryId":"<8hex>","tokensBefore":N}
{"type":"session_info","id":"...","parentId":"...","name":"user-defined name"}
```

`entryIds[]` in `SessionContext` is a parallel array to `messages[]` — maps each displayed message back to its `.jsonl` entry id, used for fork and navigate_tree calls.

## CSS Variables (`app/globals.css`)

```
--bg --bg-panel --bg-hover --bg-selected --border
--text --text-muted --text-dim
--accent --user-bg --tool-bg
--font-mono
```

## Localization

- UI strings use `useI18n()` with paired keys in `lib/i18n/en.ts` and `lib/i18n/zh.ts`; keep Skills, MCP, Packs, Plugins, Models, and Provider in English unless directed otherwise.
- Keep the provider's initial locale as English during SSR and the first client render; read browser/localStorage preference only in `useEffect` to avoid hydration mismatches.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues are tracked as GitHub issues in `sincw/pivot-ui`; use the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Five canonical roles using their default label strings (`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`). See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context — `CONTEXT.md` and `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## Agent File Writing Rules

When creating or rewriting large files:

- Prefer **chunked writes**: never emit more than **~2000 characters** in a single write call.
- Build the file in order — scaffold first, then append or edit remaining sections.
- For existing files, prefer surgical `edit` patches over full rewrites.
- Keep each chunk self-contained and valid at the point of writing (no half-open strings/blocks left dangling across chunks unless immediately closed by the next edit).
